# HW_code_refactor
This is my first homework assignment for UCF coding Boot Camp
The goal was to refactor an existing html page to make it easier for a developer to review the code
I added semantic elements to replace overused div elements
I consolidated the elements on the css stylesheet to condense and clean up the material
I got the links on the page effectively working and added alt attributes to img elements
